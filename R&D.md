# R&D Process and Technique
The more I engage in industrial coding environment, the more I realise coding is solely 20% of the process while the majority relies on a good documentation. 
The hardest framework to learn is always those who do not have an official available reference.

A well written documentation can facilitate other people to comprehend one's code and thus making the code outlive the original creator.

Here are the techniques that I have learnt:

## Data flow Diagram
  Dataflow diagram provides a visual overview of an application's mechanism. Swim lane diagram is a great tool to present the application to nontechnical personnel.

## Wireframe Diagram
  Wireframe visualizes the design. And it is much easier to alter than css. I highly recommend Figma.
  
## Framework Documentation
  Indicate what framework you are using. Which version and the link to the official documentation. I also like to provide package.json snippet.

## Feature List
A list feature for the nontechnical personnel.

## src Documentation
I like to use windows `tree /F`

## Hierarchy Diagram
Which file is root, which file imports which file

## Library Documentation
Every method, every function, with their args and default args and usage.
